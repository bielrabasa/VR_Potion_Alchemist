# VR Potion Alchemist
The story of the game is that the player is an alchemist, who has a shop in a medieval-style village. In this village, the people who live there usually go to the shop to buy potions, so the player has to follow the recipes and sell the potions.

## Zones
### Table with cauldron
This is the area where potions are crafted from ingredients. This spot contains the cauldron in the centre, primary positions on the right and a spoon on the left.



### Recipe book
This is the area where the potion recipe book is located. There are 4 potions available to brew.


### Ingredients shelf
On this shelf are all the ingredients used to make potions. The controllers will vibrate when an interactive object is approached. In addition, they will change colour slightly so that it is easy to identify that it is being held correctly.


## Instructions
### How to make a potion?
Customers will come in front of the table asking for a specific potion. The recipe you will need to follow will be obtained by looking at the recipe book. All recipes require a minimum of 1 primary potion and 2 ingredients. Once you know what ingredients and primary potion you need (ingredients can be found on the shelf and primary potions can be found on the right side of the cauldron) put them into the cauldron. **There is no specific order**. Once all the ingredients are inside the cauldron, you need to take the spoon and stir inside of it. Instantly, the resulting potion will appear to the left side of the cauldron. Gently give it to the customer, so that they will leave and make way for the next customer.

### What happens if you get the recipe wrong?
Don't worry, you can reset the cauldron by adding a potion that does not belong to the mixture the book is asking for.
